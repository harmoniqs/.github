## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ We are building next-level fine-tuned optimal control for quantum inspired by robotics

🌟 We have a number of active repos, make a PR! or message us on the [unitary foundation discord](http://discord.unitary.foundation/) for Piccolo.jl and associated packages

👩‍💻 Check out [harmoniqs.co](https://www.harmoniqs.co/) and [docs.harmoniqs.co](https://docs.harmoniqs.co) to see our landing page and our docs respectively


## Unitary HACK issues

May 28 - June 11, 2025. [unitaryHACK](https://unitaryhack.dev/) is a virtual event encouraging people to make contributions to the open source quantum ecosystem.
